============================

`uz80as` is an assembler for the Zilog Z80 and several other microprocessors.

  - Z80 family
    - Zilog Z80
    - Hitachi HD64180
    - Sharp LR35902 (Nintendo Gameboy CPU)
  - 6500 family
    - MOS Technology 6502
    - California Micro Devices G65SC02
    - Rockwell R6501, R65C02, R65C29
    - Western Design Center W65C02S
  - Datapoint 2200 (versions I & II)
  - Intel 4004, 4040, 8008, 8021, 8022, 8041, 8048, 8051, 8080, 8085

A precompiled distribution for *Microsoft Windows* is provided in a ZIP file.
It can be found at https://jorgicor.niobe.org/uz80as . After decompressing it,
you will have these files:

~~~

Compiling
=========

Getting the code from revision control
--------------------------------------

If you cloned the project from a revision control system (i.e. GitHub), you
will need first to use the GNU autotools to generate some files, in particular,
the `configure` script. Use:

    $ ./bootstrap

to generate the required files. You will need *GNU autoconf*, *GNU automake*,
*GNU texinfo* and *help2man*.

Compiling from the source distribution
--------------------------------------

If you have the official source package, and you are building on a Unix-like
environment (this includes *Cygwin* on *Windows*), you can find detailed
instructions in the file `INSTALL`. The complete source distribution can always
be found at https://jorgicor.niobe.org/uz80as .

After installing, you can type `man uz80as` to see a brief explanation on how
to use the `uz80as` program. More detailed documentation can be found using the
GNU documentation system: type `info uz80as` to read it.

Normally, after installing from source, you can find this on your system:

~~~
/usr/local/bin/uz80as                    The program executable.
/usr/local/share/man/man1/uz80as.1       The manual page.
/usr/local/share/info/uz80as.info        The info manual.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/COPYING      License.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/README       This file.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/NEWS         What's new in this version.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/INSTALL      How to compile, install and uninstall.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/AUTHORS      Authors.
~~~

If you are installing uz80as using your OS distribution package system, these
folders will probably be different. Try changing `/usr/local` to `/usr`.
